**Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game**

**Description:**
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns to mark a cell in a 3x3 grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

**Features:**
1. **Game Board:**
   - A 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
   - Each cell in the grid is clickable to allow players to make their moves.

2. **Player Turns:**
   - Alternating turns between two players.
   - Indication of the current player's turn.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Detection of a win when a player has three symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
   - Highlighting the winning combination on the board.

4. **Draw Condition:**
   - Detection of a draw when the board is full, and no player has won.

5. **Reset Button:**
   - A reset button to clear the board and start a new game.

6. **Score Tracking:**
   - Keep track of the scores for each player (Wins, Draws).

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** For creating the structure of the game, including the game board and buttons.
- **CSS:** For styling the game, including grid layout, colors, and styling for X and O.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the game logic, handling player turns, checking win/draw conditions, and updating the game state.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create a grid layout for the game board.
   - Include buttons for player interaction and a display area for game status.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Style the game board, cells, and buttons.
   - Add styling for X and O symbols.
   - Apply responsive design for different screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - Implement functions to handle player turns.
   - Check for win/draw conditions after each move.
   - Update the game state and display the result.
   - Implement a reset function to start a new game.

4. **Event Listeners:**
   - Attach event listeners to the clickable cells to handle player moves.
   - Add an event listener to the reset button.

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the game thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Test for different scenarios, including wins, draws, and game resets.

6. **Refactoring and Optimization:**
   - Refactor code for clarity and modularity.
   - Optimize performance, if necessary.

**Deployment:**
- Host the game on a web server or platforms GitHub Pages.
